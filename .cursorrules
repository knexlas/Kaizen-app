# Project: KAIZEN (The 1% App)

## Core Philosophy
We are building a "Calm Technology" goal-setting app based on the Japanese philosophy of Kaizen (continuous improvement).
- **Anti-Hustle:** No streaks, no red notification badges, no shame.
- **Micro-Steps:** Users cannot add tasks >15 mins.
- **Aesthetic:** "Japandi" (Japanese-Scandi). Cream (#FDFCF5), Charcoal (#2D2D2D), Moss Green (#4A5D23).

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React (Vite), Tailwind CSS (styling), Framer Motion (animations).
- **Backend:** Firebase (Firestore, Auth).
- **Mobile:** Capacitor (to wrap for iOS/Android).

## Key Features & Data Structure

### 1. The North Star (Goals)
- **Data:** `goals` collection.
- **UI:** Visible only as "Context" or header.
- **Critical:** Must include `emotional_why` (The user's deep motivation).

### 2. The Bento Box (Weekly Planner)
- **Concept:** A limited container for the week.
- **Constraint:** Users drag items from "North Star" into "Bento Box." Max 5 items per week.

### 3. The Daily 1% (Execution)
- **Logic:** The "Task Slicer."
- **Rule:** If a user inputs a big task, use Gemini API to break it down into 3 micro-steps.
- **The Breathing Gate:** A 30s overlay before starting a task (skippable).

### 4. Progression Logic (The Algorithm)
- **No Streaks:** We track "Cumulative Volume" (Total stones piled up).
- **Rest:** If `ease_streak` is low, suggest fewer minutes. If high, suggest +5%.

## Design Rules
- **Typography:** Serif for headings (Merriweather), Sans for UI (Inter).
- **Animations:** Slow, organic. No "bouncy" or "flashy" game-like effects.
- **Feedback:** Use Haptics (vibration) for task completion.

## Code Style
- Use Functional React Components.
- Use Tailwind for all styling.
- specific filename convention: `components/ComponentName.jsx`
